# Tech Tests

## What are we looking for?

- Your understanding of the priorities of the project.
- Your engineering skills in creating a project that's easy to start up locally and get a feature to production.
- Could I use a different endpoint, add a page, or change the designs quickly without having to ask you to show me how?
- Could I show your project to a junior developer and have them developing on your project in less than a few minutes?

In a real life situation we'd be able to add members to your team. But they're only effective if they can get setup and start developing features in your code base quickly. [SOLID] systems _and_ engineers.

## Notes

- Each of these exercises should take around an hour. Any longer than that - finish off what you're doing and we’ll talk through what’s been done and where you’d go from there.
- Prioritise your time - deliver the most value you can within the time.
- Unless stated otherwise, any included static assets can be changed or restructured as you require. (eg if you need to change the directory names or JSON structure - go for it)
- Unless stated otherwise, the product doesn't have to match the examples. It only needs the same controls and to be presentable.
- Unless stated otherwise, use any tooling, libraries, generators, etc that you fancy. But please keep it simple and repeatable - it needs to work on my machine.
- Nothing installed globally to develop or run this project.
- We like our products to be accessible, but semantic and well structured HTML is perfect for the purpose of these exercises.
- Try commit per feature - not an issue if you don't, but it's great to see a timeline.
- No references to Radically Digital please as this may be used in another test.
- Put it up in Github or Gitlab and **add me as a collaborator or developer respectively** [Github/olmesm](https://github.com/olmesm) / [Gitlab/olmesm](https://gitlab.com/olmesm).

Enjoy and feel free to send me a message if you get stuck with anything or have any questions - we're not here to trip you up but start a team-orientated technical conversation.
