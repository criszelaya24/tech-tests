# Tech Tests

These are currently all the tech tests we send out.

- Enjoy and feel free to send a message if you get stuck with anything or have any questions (especially process control) - we're not here to trip you up but start a team-orientated technical conversation.
- Prioritise your time - deliver the most value you can within the time.
- Put it up in Github or Gitlab and **add me as an Admin** [Github/olmesm](https://github.com/olmesm) / [Gitlab/olmesm](https://gitlab.com/olmesm).
